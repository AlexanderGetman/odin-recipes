        familiar with modern Japanese culture.</p>
    <h3 class="underline">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 big eggs</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp ketchup (+ more for decoration)</li>
        <li>1/2 defrosted mixed vegetables</li>
        <li>1/2 onion</li>
        <li>6 Tbsp shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="underline">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together eggs with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Start cooking the rice. Saute diced onions in 1 tablespoon of sesame oil over medium-high heat for 2-3
            minutes until the onions become translucent. stir in the rice, the rest of the sesame oil, soy sauce, and
            ketchup and keep stirring rice mixture for another 3-4 minutes or until it starts to brown.</li>
        <li>Add in the defrosted mixed veggies to heat through. Then transfer it to the bowl and cover it to retain
            heat.</li>
        <li>Add half of the whisked eggs to the same pan over medium heat and tilt the pan to get the mixture to spread
            all around and coat the bottom of the pan. Sprinkle half of the cheese over the eggs and let the eggs and
            cheese cook, untouched for about 1-2 minutes. Then, spoon half the rice mixture to the center of the eggs,
            and use a spatula to fold over the eggs over the top of the rice to make an omelette.
        </li>
        <li>Turn the omelette onto a paper towel, using the towel to put the edges of the egg together to seal into
            omelette shape.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process with the egg and rice mixtures to make the second omelet. Serve them warm, topping with
            more ketchup.
